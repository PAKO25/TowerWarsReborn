# Installation

## Requirements

- **Minecraft Server Version**: Paper 1.21 or higher
  > ⚠️ Only tested on **Paper 1.21.4 & 1.21.7** — use other versions at your own risk.

## Steps

1. **Download the Plugin**  
   Visit the [Releases Page](../../releases) and download the latest `.jar` file for `TowerWarsReborn`.

2. **Install the Plugin**  
   Place the downloaded `.jar` file into your server’s `plugins/` directory.

3. **Restart Your Server**  
   Restart (not reload) your server to allow the plugin to load and initialize properly.

4. **Verify Installation**  
   Check the console logs for a successful startup message from `TowerWarsReborn`.

## Advanced

If you want the plugin for other versions feel free to compile it from source against the desired version.
Keep in mind however, that the plugin uses NMS (net.minecraft.server) and I haven't implemented any reflection yet.
Cross version compatibility is therefore highly unlikely.
